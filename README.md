0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
By doing this project we suppose to be able to understand the following:
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
